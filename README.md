# NSDOS Leaf EDitor
An ED (GNU + CP/M) inspired editor for the NorthStar Graphics Disk Operating System version 1.0.0AQ

I'd recomend having syntax highlighting for the intel 8080's pnemonics, and tabsize of 8. Though it's perfectly acceptable to view it with no highlighting.
wrote a simple vim syntax file for it, [here](https://github.com/sage-etcher/vim-i8080-syntax), but for other edittors you're on your own
